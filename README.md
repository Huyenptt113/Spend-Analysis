# Spend Analysis: An analysis based on THL procurement data 2020-2021

# Problem & motivation:
* The objective of the analysis is to conduct a spend analysis on one public organization and to address a following high-level question: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the public spending in the Finnish healthcare sector?
* This project focuses on Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (in Finnish: Terveyden ja Hyvinvoinnin Laitos,THL), the government’s expert organization on health-related matters, whose purchase invoice (=spend) data to analyze

# Dataset:
Annual invoice data for all Finnish governmental agencies is available at:
https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/tutkihankintoja-data
Each year’s data since 2016 is available as an independent csv-file. 

# Aim of study:
The analysis aims to answer the following questions:
* How big is the spend compared to organization’s side and how has it developed? What might be the reasons for high/low use of external resources?
* Compared to spend volume, does the procurement unit have many or few suppliers? How is the spend distributed by the suppliers / by the procurement categories (e.g., are certain suppliers dominating certain categories etc.)?
* How either the total spending, its distribution per category, supplier or account, or number of suppliers (or any other distinguishable factor) has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?
* Is there any temporal pattern in the data through which COVID-19 pandemic is distinguishable?
* Based on the analysis, where and how should the organization focus its future efforts to enhance procurement practices (e.g., in terms of spending, efficiency of procurement, supplier relationship management etc.)?


# Limitations on the analysis:
* The data focus specifically on COVID-19 pandemic period, conclusions drawn from the case are not necessarily applicable for other cases and in hindsight, there might be biases to plan future procurements according to these assumptions as the risks could stem from other issues.
* The lack of information about contexts in which the government is operating also prevents us from having a holistic view on the issues, therefore potential optimizations or risks might be overlooked.
